## 🧠 Null Value Handling Strategy

| Column         | Type        | Missing Values | Handling Strategy                                                  |
|----------------|-------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Order ID       | Identifier  | 7              | Filled with `'Unknown'`                                            |
| Customer ID    | Identifier  | 6              | Filled with `'Unknown'`                                            |
| Customer Name  | Identifier  | 3              | Filled with `'Unknown'`                                            |
| Order Date     | Date        | 15             | Imputed manually using year/month distribution and region logic    |
| City           | Categorical | 12             | Filled with `'Unknown'`                                            |
| Region         | Categorical | 4              | Inferred using City; dropped row if unmatched                      |
| Category       | Categorical | 7              | Filled using frequency + region-category relationships             |
| Quantity       | Numeric     | 7              | Inferred using similar records (category, region, date)            |
| Sales          | Numeric     | 11             | Filled using average sales by category/region                      |
| Profit         | Numeric     | 12             | Filled with `0.0` (assumed no profit or unknown)                   |

## 📌 Key Learnings

- Handling missing data requires **context-aware decisions**.
- Not all columns should be treated the same — identifiers, dates, categories, and numbers each need different approaches.
- Visualizing before and after null handling helps verify the effectiveness of your strategy.
- Clean data is critical for valid future analysis like sales trends, customer segmentation, or forecasting.
